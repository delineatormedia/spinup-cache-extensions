# Spinup Cache Extensions

## Disclaimer
This WordPress plugin is extremely early in development. Do not use this
on a production website unless you are really confident you understand how
it works.

## Description

This plugin is intended to extend the functionalities of the
[SpinupWP Helper plugin](https://github.com/deliciousbrains/spinupwp-plugin).

Currently, it adds a "Cache" page under the settings menu which allows a user
to clear the site's Nginx cache from within WP Admin.
